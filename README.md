# jbdl Version 0.80
## Installation.
Go to home directory, and run
```
pip install -e .
```
to install jbdl.

If you want to install jaxRBDL with both CPU and NVidia GPU support, you must first install CUDA and CuDNN and add environment variables:

```
echo export 'PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"'  >> ~/.bashrc
echo export 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Before ```pip install -e .```, make sure the environment variable CUDA_PATH and option -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER in ```setup.py``` are set to the CUDA Toolkit install directory:
```
CUDA_PATH = '/usr/local/cuda'
-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
```

The jaxlib version must correspond to the version of the existing CUDA installation. In ubuntu, you can check the cuda version by cheking
the folder under /usr/local/cuda.
* For CUDA 11.1, use cuda111. 
* For CUDA 11.0, use cuda110.
* Other CUDA versions has not been tested with jaxRBDL(cuosqp).

Take installation with CUDA 11.1 for example:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda111]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
```

** A warning: Other versions of jax, jaxlib and python has not been tested. Some may lead to unpredictable errors. **

Then, set the environment variable ```WITH_JAX_CUDA=yes``` to enable CUDA support before installation:
```
export WITH_JAX_CUDA=yes
```

## Examples.
Go to demo directory under the scripts folder, and run
```
python test_half_max_v5.py
```
or 
```
python test_whole_max_v2.py
```
to test the functionality of jbdl.
